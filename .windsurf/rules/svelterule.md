Always use Svelte 5 runes and Svelte 5 syntax. Runes do not need to be imported, they are globals. $state() runes are always declared using `let`, never with `const`. When passing a function to $derived, you must always use $derived.by(() => ...). Error boundaries can only catch errors during component rendering and at the top level of an $effect inside the error boundary. Error boundaries do not catch errors in onclick or other event handlers
